Developed a Secured Lottery System Using Smart Contract and Blockchain Technology , increasing transparency and reduce frauds in the lottery industry. Once the contract has been deployed by the administrator, there will be a minimum contribution amount for players to register in the game and a price pool will be maintained by the smart contract. The winning process will be structured in a way such that only the administrator\'s wallet will be authorized to initiate the process to randomly pick an address and the smart contract will by definition transfer the prize to the winner.
